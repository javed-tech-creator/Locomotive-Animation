It is Water that helps us to lead a comfortable life on this planet. Our bodies are made up of 70% water, which is why Water is such an important compound for us. We use Water for so many purposes. We need water for drinking, cooking, bathing, and cleaning. Without Water, life would be impossible on the planet. Water is found on the Earth in the form of rivers, oceans, seas, ponds, lakes, streams, and glaciers. The composition of Water remains the same throughout the Earth. </p>
